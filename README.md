# The-Good-Feet-ShopIn today’s technology driven world, the market with technology is enhancing day by day and in each industry, 
information technology has impacted tremendously that we thought to choose to make a business to customer (B2C) E-commerce websites. 
We have decided to make a user-friendly website on ‘SHOES’ in which we can improve with automated system where we can provide services without any hindrance. 
The system allows customers to first create an account and then login so that they can use the services anytime and from anywhere. 
The system will be capable enough that it provides the functions and features such as categories about the product, variations, order status and history,
search and filter options In addition, the system will be efficient enough that it can complete the online transactions for the masses.
However, special authorisations will be given to the admin where they can add, delete, modify the information about the products and also assist their customer credentials.
